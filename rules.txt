o	4 scorecards, if both the rank and the suit guessed are correct 
o	2 scorecards, if a joker is correctly guessed

- Players who correctly predict the last face-down card win all remaining scorecards.
- The reward is substantial and reflects the difficulty of the prediction.
- Bonus should be awarded to: -

o	if none of the predictions were correct, then the player who correctly predicted the rank of the last card
o	if none of the rank predictions were correct either, then the player who correctly predicted the suit of the last card 
o   if none of the suit predictions were correct either, then the player won the last scorecard
